# Data still requires manual curation but need a system to alert DAC when data is ready for processing and alert PEC team when new data is available. Manual curation occurs while the data is in the Staging `Folder`. A fileview points to all of the folders shared with the internal consortia. This script will run daily to detect when new data is visible to the consortia; i.e. data is moved from Staging to PEC `Folder`.
